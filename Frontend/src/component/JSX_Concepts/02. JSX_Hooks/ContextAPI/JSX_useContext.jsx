// Note - it is a way of passing data through the component tree, without having to pass props manualy at every entry level, ( it allows data to be shared across components without explecitly passing props down the component), In React app, data is passed from a parent component to child components via props. However, in deep component trees, prop drilling can become problematic. useContext solves this by allowing components to directly access shared data. createContext() - create a contextObject, Provider - a component provides context value to the children, useContext(Consumer) - a hook alloes us to consume the context
